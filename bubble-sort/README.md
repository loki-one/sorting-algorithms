## Bubble Sort:

* Easiest but not very used.
* Not used much in production code.
* Consists of two loops:
  1. Outer loop that goes around all the numbers once.
  2. Inner loop compares and swap.

### Big O:

* _Trick:_ two nested loops, hence O(n*n)

* **Best:** O(n)
* **Average:** O(n^2)
* **Worst:** O(n^2)

### Space Complexity:

* **Worst:** O(1)
* As we don't create or delete any array but work on the same one.
